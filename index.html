         <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>
         <p>After qualifying in 2016 with a first, BSc Hons degree in adult nursing I began my nursing career on a respiratory ward in Bournemouth. Working both on the ward and within the acute lung unit I developed core skills as well as those specific to the speciality including chest drain management and non-invasive ventilation (CPAP, BIPAP), which were an important and enjoyable stepping stone in my career. During this time I also developed an interest in palliative care, which was strengthened when I undertook the QELCA (Quality End of Life Care for All) course and feel I thrive best in an environment that facilitates the delivery of high quality patient-centred care.</p> 

         <p>Owing to my fascination with Chinese culture, in 2017 I took a career break to undertake a 5 month scholarship In China and achieved HSK level 4 in Mandarin Chinese.</p>
            
         <p>In 2019 I left Bournemouth and relocated to Oxford where I have since worked as a chemotherapy nurse on the day treatment unit (DTU) at the Churchill hospital. Since joining DTU and completing the SACT Administration and Patient Care course at Oxford Brookes University, I have gained valuable experience in cancer care across both the haematology and oncology sides of the department and developed proficiency in a number of clinical skills including (but not limited to): pre-treatment assessments, SACT administration, administration of blood products and venesection. I later undertook further studies at level 7, whilst working full-time, to aid with my professional development and in March 2023 I was awarded a Post Graduate Certificate (PG Cert) in Cancer Care.</p>
